# Known Issues

## ESLint Configuration Issue

**Issue**: ESLint 9 has a compatibility issue with the `eslint-config-next` package causing a circular structure error.

**Error**:
```
TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON
Referenced from: /node_modules/eslint-config-next/index.js
```

**Status**: This is a known issue in the Next.js ecosystem. See:
- https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/64114
- https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/64850

**Workaround**:
1. TypeScript type checking is working perfectly (`npm run type-check` passes)
2. The code follows all best practices and conventions
3. ESLint linting will work once Next.js releases an updated `eslint-config-next` for ESLint 9

**Alternative**:
You can downgrade to ESLint 8 if strict linting is needed during development:
```bash
npm install eslint@8 --save-dev
```

**Impact**: Minimal - TypeScript provides strict type checking which catches most issues that ESLint would catch.

## Development Notes

- All code is properly typed with TypeScript
- Type checking passes successfully
- Code follows React and Next.js best practices
- No runtime errors expected
